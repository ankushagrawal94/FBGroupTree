FBGroupTree

Visualize your effect on the growth of the community by determining how many members you were directly and indirectly responsible for adding to the community


To Do:

  MVP:
    Need to Verify I'm not losing data
      Check that all people are included
        No missing people among unique names
          If the counts do not match, may need to go to FB api and get the list of people to figure out who is missing
        Ensure people with repeat names are all accounted for
          I might have screwed this part up :/
    Need to convert data from tab delimited to JSON for D3
      Probably want to put it into a tree first
      See example in HTML file for more details on JSON format
    Need to desaign a web page that has the visualization
